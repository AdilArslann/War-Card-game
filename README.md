# War-Card-game


## Game Rules

1. Initialize a standard 52-card deck in random order.
2. Split the deck evenly between two players.
3. For each round, both players reveal the top card of their decks.
4. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
5. If both cards have the same value, a "war" occurs. Both players draw additional cards to resolve the war, and the player with the higher card wins all cards involved in the war.
6. The game continues until one player has all the cards or a predetermined number of rounds have been played.

## Technical Requirements
